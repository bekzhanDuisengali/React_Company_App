        <h1>My name is Bekzhan</h1>
        <p>I did this project specially for weather, because i think it's one of the most interesting topic for Front-End beginnner developer, and here i did big work with hooks, localStorage, components, props , setState, router, api (fetch) </p>
        <p>I hope you will rate my project with high grade because i spent really long time and i like working with React, js, css and other tools. <br />
        And by the way i used OpenWeatherApi to do requests and get information. 
        </p>
        <br />
        By the way i really love Front End developing.
